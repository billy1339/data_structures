# sets are useful to see if an item exists.
# checking the inclusion of something.
# sets are kinda stored in a structured way, so that you can kinda do a binary search.

# first in, first out

# in a queue you really only care about the first and the last element. pushing and popping


# bit => 0/1, represented as B
